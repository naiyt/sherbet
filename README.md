# Sherbet

Sherbet is a gem used to generate billion dollar ideas. Who needs to pay the creative person on your team when you can automate it?

Okay, actually this is just a small dumb gem that I'm using to demonstrate [Sorbet](
https://sorbet.org) for the Sept 4th, 2019 [Downtown URUG meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Utah-Ruby-Users-Group/events/twjnhqyzmbgb/). You won't actually be able to make any money off of this, but maybe you'll have a laugh.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sherbet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sherbet

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
